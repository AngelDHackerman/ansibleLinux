# String/words can be encripted within a playbook
# You must type one of this commands in order to encrypt a string or all the file:
# ? ansible-vault encrypt_string httpd
# ? ansible-vault create/encrypt nameOfFile.yml


# This is how it looks a encrypte file/word:

# 1. you use the command: ansible-vault encrypt_string wordToEncrypt
# 2. In a playbook previously wrote you copy and paste the output of the last command, in the "vars: secret:" section

# 3. you can see all this in the encryptPlaybook.yml
# 4. in order to run the playbook use the command:
# ? ansible-playbook nameOfYourFile.yml --ask-vault-pass
